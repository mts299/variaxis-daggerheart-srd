    <h1>Details</h1><h4>DESCRIPTION</h4><p>A living landslide of boulders and
    dust, as large as a house.</p><h4>MOTIVES &amp; TACTICS</h4><p>Avalanche,
    knock over, pummel</p><hr /><h1>EXPERIENCE</h1><p></p><hr
    /><h1>FEATURES</h1><ul><li>Slow - Passive: When you spotlight the Elemental
    and they don’t have a token on their stat block, they can’t act yet. Place a
    token on their stat block and describe what they’re preparing to do. When
    you spotlight the Elemental and they have a token on their stat block, clear
    the token and they can act.</li><li>Crushing Blows - Passive: When the
    Elemental makes a successful attack, the target must mark an Armor Slot
    without receiving its benefits (they can still use armor to reduce the
    damage). If they can’t mark an Armor Slot, they must mark an additional
    HP.</li><li>Immovable Object - Passive: An attack that would move the
    Elemental moves them two fewer ranges (for example, Far becomes Very Close).
    When the Elemental takes physical damage, reduce it by 7.</li><li>Rockslide
    - Action: Mark a Stress to create a rockslide that buries the land in front
    of Elemental within Close range with rockfall. All targets in this area must
    make an Agility Reaction Roll (19). Targets who fail take 2d12+5 physical
    damage and become Vulnerable until their next roll with Hope. Targets who
    succeed take half damage.</li><li>Momentum - Reaction: When the Elemental
    makes a successful attack against a PC, you gain a Fear.</li></ul>
