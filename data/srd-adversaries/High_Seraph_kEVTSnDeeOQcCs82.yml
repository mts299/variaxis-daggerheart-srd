    spotlighted up to three times per GM turn. Spend Fear as usual to spotlight
    them.</li><li>Divine Flight - Passive: While the Seraph is flying, spend a
    Fear to move up to Far range instead of Close range before taking an
    action.</li><li>Judgment - Action: Spend a Fear to make a target Guilty in
    the eyes of the Seraph’s god until the Seraph is defeated. While Guilty, the
    target doesn’t gain Hope on a result with Hope. When the Seraph succeeds on
    a standard attack against a Guilty target, they deal Severe damage instead
    of their standard damage. The Seraph can only mark one target at a
    time.</li><li>God Rays - Action: Mark a Stress to reflect a sliver of
    divinity as a searing beam of light that hits up to twenty targets within
    Very Far range. Targets must make a Presence Reaction Roll, with
    disadvantage if they are marked Guilty. Targets who fail take 4d6+12 magic
    damage. Targets who succeed take half damage.</li><li>We Are One - Action:
    Once per scene, spend a Fear to spotlight all other adversaries within Far
    range. Attacks they make while spotlighted in this way deal half
    damage.</li></ul>
