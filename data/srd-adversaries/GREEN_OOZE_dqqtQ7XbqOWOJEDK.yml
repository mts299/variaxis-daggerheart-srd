    <h1>Details</h1><h4>DESCRIPTION</h4><p>A moving mound of translucent green
    slime.</p><h4>MOTIVES &amp; TACTICS</h4><p>Camouflage, consume and multiply,
    creep up, envelop</p><hr /><h1>EXPERIENCE</h1><p>Camouflage +3</p><hr
    /><h1>FEATURES</h1><ul><li>Slow - Passive: When you spotlight the Ooze and
    they don't have a token on their stat block, they can't act yet. Place a
    token on their stat block and describe what they're preparing to do. When
    you spotlight the Ooze and they have a token on their stat block, clear the
    token and they can act.</li><li>Acidic Form - Passive: When the Ooze makes a
    successful attack, the target must mark an Armor Slot without receiving its
    benefits (they can still use armor to reduce the damage). If they can't mark
    an Armor Slot, they must mark an additional HP.</li><li>Envelop - Action:
    Make a standard attack against a target within Melee range. On a success,
    the Ooze envelops them and the target must mark 2 Stress. The target must
    mark an additional Stress when they make an action roll. If the Ooze takes
    Severe damage, the target is freed.</li><li>Split - Reaction: When the Ooze
    has 3 or more HP marked, you can spend a Fear to split them into two Tiny
    Green Oozes (with no marked HP or Stress). Immediately spotlight both of
    them.</li></ul>
