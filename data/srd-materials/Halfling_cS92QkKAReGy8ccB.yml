    hairy feet and prominent rounded ears. <span class="og-omit">On average,
    halflings are 3–4 feet (0.9–1.2 m) in height, and their ears, nose, and feet
    are larger in proportion to the rest of their body. Members of this ancestry
    live for around 150 years, and a halfling's appearance is likely to remain
    youthful even as they progress from adulthood into old age. Halflings are
    naturally attuned to the magnetic fields of the Mortal Realm, granting them
    a strong internal compass. They also possess acute senses of hearing and
    smell, and can often detect those who are familiar to them by the sound of
    their movements.</span></p>
