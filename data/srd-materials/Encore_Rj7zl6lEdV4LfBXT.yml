    <p>When an ally within <strong>Close</strong> range deals damage to an
    adversary, you can make a <strong>Spellcast Roll</strong> against that same
    target. On a success, you deal the same damage to the target that your ally
    dealt. If your <strong>Spellcast Roll</strong> succeeds with Fear, place
    this card in your vault.</p>
