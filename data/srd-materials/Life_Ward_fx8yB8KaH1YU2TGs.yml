    <p>Spend 3 Hope and choose an ally within <strong>Close</strong> range. They
    are marked with a glowing sigil of protection. When this ally would make a
    death move, they clear a Hit Point instead. </p><p>This effect ends when it
    saves the target from a death move, you cast <em><strong>Life
