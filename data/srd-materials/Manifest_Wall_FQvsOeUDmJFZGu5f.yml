    <p>Make a <strong>Spellcast Roll</strong> (15). Once per rest on a success,
    spend a Hope to create a temporary magical wall between two points within
    <strong>Far</strong> range. It can be up to 50 feet high and form at any
    angle. Creatures or objects in its path are shunted to a side of your
    choice. The wall stays up until your next rest or you cast Manifest Wall
    again.</p>
