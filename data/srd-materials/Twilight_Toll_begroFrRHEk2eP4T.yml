    <p>Choose a target within <strong>Far</strong> range. When you succeed on an
    action roll against them that doesn't result in making a damage roll, place
    a token on this card. When you deal damage to this target, spend any number
    of tokens to add a [[/roll d12]] for each token spent to your damage roll.
    </p><p>You can only hold Twilight Toll on one creature at a time. When you
    choose a new target or take a rest, clear all unspent tokens.</p>
