    Breath}</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Drakona resemble wingless dragons in
    humanoid form and possess a powerful elemental breath. <span
    class="og-omit">All drakona have thick scales that provide excellent natural
    armor against both attacks and the forces of nature. They are large in size,
    ranging from 5–7 feet (1.5–2.1m) on average, with long sharp teeth. New
    teeth grow throughout a drakona's approximately 350-year lifespan, so they
    are never in danger of permanently losing an incisor. Unlike their dragon
    ancestors, drakona don't have wings and can't fly without magical aid.
    Members of this ancestry pass down the element of their breath through
    generations, though in rare cases, a drakona's elemental power will differ
    from the rest of their family's.</span></p>
