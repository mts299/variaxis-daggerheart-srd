    <p>Clanks are sentient mechanical beings built from a variety of materials,
    including metal, wood, and stone. <span class="og-omit">They can resemble
    humanoids, animals, or even inanimate objects. Like organic beings, their
    bodies come in a wide array of sizes. Because of their bespoke construction,
    many clanks have highly specialized physical configurations. Examples
    include clawed hands for grasping, wheels for movement, or built-in
    weaponry.</span></p><p class="og-omit">Many clanks embrace body
    modifications for style as well as function, and members of other ancestries
    often turn to clank artisans to construct customized mobility aids and
    physical adornments. Other ancestries can create clanks, even using their
    own physical characteristics as inspiration, but it's also common for clanks
    to build one another. A clank's lifespan extends as long as they're able to
    acquire or craft new parts, making their physical form effectively immortal.
    That said, their minds are subject to the effects of time, and deteriorate
    as the magic that powers them loses potency.</p><h4 class="h6">Ancestry
