    resemble anthropomorphic turtles with large, domed shells into which they
    can retract. <span class="og-omit">On average, they range from 4–6 feet
    (1.2–1.8 m) in height, and their head and body shapes can resemble any type
    of turtle.</span></p><p class="og-omit">Galapa come in a variety of earth
    tones—most often shades of green and brown— and possess unique patterns on
    their shells. Members of this ancestry can draw their head, arms, and legs
    into their shell for protection to use it as a natural shield when defensive
    measures are needed. Some supplement their shell's strength or appearance by
    attaching armor or carving unique designs, but the process is exceedingly
    painful. Most galapa move slowly no matter their age, and they can live
    approximately 150 years.</p>
