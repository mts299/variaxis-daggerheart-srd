    <p>You can peek into the minds of others. Spend a Hope to read the vague
    surface thoughts of a target within <strong>Far</strong> range. Make a
    <strong>Spellcast Roll</strong> against the target to delve for deeper, more
    hidden thoughts. On a roll with Fear, the target might, at the GM's
    discretion, become aware that you're reading their thoughts.</p>
