    <p><em><strong>Adjust Appearance:</strong></em> You magically shift your
    appearance and clothing to avoid
    recognition.</p><p><em><strong>Parallecta:</strong></em> Spend 2 Hope to
    cast this spell on yourself or an ally within <strong>Close</strong> range.
    The next time the target makes an attack, they can roll an additional target
    within range that their attack roll would succeed against. You can only hold
    this spell on one creature at a
    time.</p><p><em><strong>Illusion:</strong></em> Make a <strong>Spellcast
    Roll</strong> (14). On a success, create a temporary visual illusion no
    larger than you within <strong>Close</strong> range that lasts for as long
    as you look at it. It holds up to scrutiny until an observer is within
    <strong>Melee</strong> range.</p><p></p>
