  description: >-
    <p>Make a <strong>Spellcast Roll</strong> (15). On a success, you place an
    arcane marking on the ground where you currently stand. </p><p>The next time
    you successfully cast Rift Walker, a rift in space opens up, providing safe
    passage back to the exact spot where the marking was placed. </p><p>This
    rift stays open until you choose to close it or you cast another spell. You
    can drop the spell at any time to cast Rift Walker again and place the
    marking somewhere new.</p>
