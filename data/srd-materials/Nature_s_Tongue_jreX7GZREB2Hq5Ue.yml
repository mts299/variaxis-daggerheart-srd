    to the plants and animals around you, make an <strong>Instinct Roll

    a roll with Fear, their knowledge might be limited or come at a
    cost.</p><p>Additionally, before you make a <strong>Spellcast Roll</strong>
    while within a natural environment, you can spend a Hope to gain a +2 bonus
