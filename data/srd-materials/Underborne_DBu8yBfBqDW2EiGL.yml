    Living}</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Being part of an underborne community
    means you're from a subterranean society. Many underborne live right beneath
    the cities and villages of other collectives, while some live much deeper.
    <span class="og-omit">These communities range from small family groups in
    burrows to massive metropolises in caverns of stone. In many locales,
    underborne are recognized for their incredible boldness and skill that
    enable great feats of architecture and engineering. Underborne are regularly
    hired for their bravery, as even the least daring among them has likely
    encountered formidable belowground beasts, and learning to dispatch such
    creatures is common practice amongst these societies. Because of the dangers
    of their environment, many underborne communities develop unique nonverbal
    languages that prove equally useful on the surface.</span></p>
