    data-bs-original-title aria-describedby="tooltip351527"><strong>Mark a
    Stress</strong></a> to magically transform into a creature of your <a
    href="https://callmepartario.github.io/og-dhsrd/#define-tier"
    data-bs-original-title>tier</a> or lower from the <a
    href="https://callmepartario.github.io/og-dhsrd/#define-druid-beastform-options"
    data-bs-original-title>Beastform</a> list. You can drop out of this form at
    any time. While transformed, you can't use weapons or cast spells from <a
    href="https://callmepartario.github.io/og-dhsrd/#define-domain-card"
    data-bs-original-title>domain cards</a>, but you can still use other
    features or abilities you have access to. Spells you cast before you
    transform stay active and last for their normal duration, and you can talk
    and communicate as normal. Additionally, you gain the Beastform's features,
    add their <a
    href="https://callmepartario.github.io/og-dhsrd/#define-evasion"
    data-bs-original-title>Evasion</a> bonus to your Evasion, and use the <a
    href="https://callmepartario.github.io/og-dhsrd/#define-trait"
    data-bs-original-title>trait</a> specified in their <a
    href="https://callmepartario.github.io/og-dhsrd/#define-druid-beastform-categories"
    data-bs-original-title>statistics</a> for your <a
    href="https://callmepartario.github.io/og-dhsrd/#define-attack-roll"
    data-bs-original-title>attack</a>. While you're in a Beastform, your armor
    becomes part of your body and you mark <a
    href="https://callmepartario.github.io/og-dhsrd/#define-armor"
    data-bs-original-title>Armor Slots</a> as usual; when you drop out of a
    Beastform, those marked <a
    href="https://callmepartario.github.io/og-dhsrd/#define-armor"
    data-bs-original-title>Armor Slots</a> remain marked. If you mark your last
    <a href="https://callmepartario.github.io/og-dhsrd/#define-hit-point"
    data-bs-original-title>Hit Point</a>, you automatically drop out of this
    form.</p>
