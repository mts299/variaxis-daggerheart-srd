    <p>You lay your hands upon a creature and channel healing magic to close
    their wounds. When you can take a few minutes to focus on the target you're
    helping, you can spend 2 Hope to clear a Hit Point or a Stress on
    them.</p><p>Once per long rest, when you spend this healing time learning
    something new about them or revealing something about yourself, you can
    clear 2 Hit Points or 2 Stress on them instead.</p>
