    </p><h2>Description</h2><p>Being
    The **Crimson Claws** are a mysterious and secretive faction of criminals and mercenaries who operate in the shadows. 
    <span class="og-omit">With no allegiance to anyone but their own, they can be hired to perform any task, from theft 
    and assassination to espionage. Their home is an unforgiving landscape of high mountains, dark forests, and 
    fog-shrouded cliffs, where hidden cities are known only to the locals. Constantly honing their skills and always 
    on the lookout for their next lucrative contract, they are the world's most cunning and dangerous underground 
    criminals. </span></p>
