    short humanoids with square frames, dense musculature, and thick hair. <span
    class="og-omit">Their average height ranges from 4–5½ feet (1.2–1.7 m), and
    they are often broad in proportion to their stature. Their skin and nails
    contain a high amount of keratin, making them naturally resilient. This
    allows dwarves to embed gemstones into their bodies and decorate themselves
    with tattoos or piercings.</span></p><p class="og-omit">Their hair grows
    thickly—usually on their heads, but some dwarves have thick hair across
    their bodies as well. Dwarves of all genders can grow facial hair, which
    they often style in elaborate arrangements. Typically, dwarves live up to
    250 years of age, maintaining their muscle mass well into later life.</p>
