    <p>Make a <strong>Spellcast Roll</strong> against a target within
    <strong>Close</strong> range. On a success, spend a Hope to conjure
    suppressive magic around the target that encompasses everything within
    <strong>Very Close</strong> range of them and follows them as they move. The
    target and anything within the area is <em><strong>Silenced</strong></em>
    until the GM spends a Fear on their turn to clear this condition, you cast
    Hush again, or you take Major damage.</p><p>While
    <em><strong>Silenced</strong></em>, they can't make noise and can't cast
    spells.</p>
