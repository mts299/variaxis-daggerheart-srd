  description: >-
    <p>Make a <strong>Spellcast Roll (16)</strong>. Once per long rest on a
    success, choose a point within <strong>Far</strong> range and create a
    visible zone of protection there for all allies within <strong>Very
    Close</strong> range of that point. When you do, place a [[/roll d6]] on
    this card with the 1 value facing up. </p><p>When an ally in this zone takes
    damage, they reduce it by the die's value. You then increase the die's value
    by one. </p><p>When the die's value would exceed 6, this effect ends.</p>
