    <p>Make a <strong>Spellcast Roll</strong> to unleash powerful rays of
    burning sunlight against all adversaries in front of you within Far range.
    On a success, spend any number of Hope and force that many targets you
    succeeded against to make a <strong>Reaction Roll
    (14</strong>).</p><p>Targets who succeed take [[/roll 3d20+3]] magic damage.
    <br />Targets who fail take [[/roll 4d20+5]] magic damage and are
    temporarily <em><strong>Stunned</strong></em>. </p><p>While
    <em><strong>Stunned</strong></em>, they can't use reactions and can't take
    any other actions until they clear this condition.</p>
