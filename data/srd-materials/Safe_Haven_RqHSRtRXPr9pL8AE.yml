  description: >-
    <p>When you have a few minutes of calm to focus, you can spend 2 Hope to
    summon your Safe Haven, a large interdimensional home where you and your
    allies can take shelter. </p><p>When you do, a magical door appears
    somewhere within <strong>Close</strong> range. Only creatures of your choice
    can enter. Once inside, you can make the entrance invisible. You and anyone
    else inside can always exit. Once you leave, the doorway must be summoned
    again. </p><p>When you take a rest within your own Safe Haven, you can
    choose an additional downtime move.</p>
