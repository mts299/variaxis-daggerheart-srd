    </p><h2>Description</h2><p>Being
    The Vesperian Scholars are an intellectual faction dedicated to the scientific study of magic.  
    <span class="og-omit">Renowned for their ability to manifest new magical items and analyze 
    ancient artifacts from the Great War, they live in a network of technologically and magically 
    advanced cities connected by portals. Their society is built around universities and libraries 
    where they give lectures and collaborate on new discoveries. While largely detached from politics, 
    they find the ruins of the Heart of Arbor fascinating and often lend their magical expertise to the 
    Celestial Guard.</span></p>
