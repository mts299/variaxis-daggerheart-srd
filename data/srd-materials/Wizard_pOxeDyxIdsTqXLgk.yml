    individual study, those known as wizards acquire and hone immense magical
    power over years of learning using a variety of tools, including books,
    stones, potions, and herbs. <span class="og-omit">Some wizards dedicate
    their lives to mastering a particular school of magic, while others learn
    from a wide variety of disciplines. Many wizards become wise and powerful
    figures in their communities, advising rulers, providing medicines and
    healing, and even leading war councils. While these mages all work toward
    the common goal of collecting magical knowledge, wizards often have the most
    conflict within their own ranks, as the acquisition, keeping, and sharing of
    powerful secrets is a topic of intense debate that has resulted in
    innumerable deaths.</span></p>
