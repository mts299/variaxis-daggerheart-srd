    Claws}</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Katari are feline humanoids with
    retractable claws, vertically slit pupils, and high, triangular ears. <span
    class="og-omit">They can also have small, pointed canine teeth, soft fur,
    and long whiskers that assist their perception and navigation. Their ears
    can swivel nearly 180 degrees to detect sound, adding to their heightened
    senses. Katari may look more or less feline or humanoid, with catlike
    attributes in the form of hair, whiskers, and a muzzle.</span></p><p
    class="og-omit">About half of the katari population have tails. Their skin
    and fur come in a wide range of hues and patterns, including solid colors,
    calico tones, tabby stripes, and an array of spots, patches, marbling, or
    bands. Their height ranges from about 3–6½ feet (0.9–2.0 m), and they live
    to around 150 years.</p>
