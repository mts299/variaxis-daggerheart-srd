    <p>Make a <strong>Spellcast Roll</strong> (16). Once per rest on a success,
    all targets within Very Far range who aren't flying must make a
    <strong>Reaction Roll (18)</strong>. Targets who fail take [[/roll 3d10+8]]
    physical damage and are temporarily
    @UUID[Actor.gAYU0cEMgszrVS1E.Item.KL8vLv3tiswbsMiZ]{Vulnerable}. Targets who
    succeed take half damage. Additionally, when you succeed on the Spellcast
    Roll, all terrain within <strong>Very Far</strong> range becomes difficult
    to move through and structures within this range might sustain damage or
    crumble.</p>
