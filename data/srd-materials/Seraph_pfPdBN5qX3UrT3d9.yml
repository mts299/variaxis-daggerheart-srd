    <p>Seraphs are divine fighters and healers imbued with sacred purpose. <span
    class="og-omit">A wide array of deities exist within the realms, and thus
    numerous kinds of seraphs are appointed by these gods. Their ethos
    traditionally aligns with the domain or goals of their god, such as
    defending the weak, exacting vengeance, protecting a land or artifact, or
    upholding a particular faith. Some seraphs ally themselves with an army or
    locale, much to the satisfaction of their rulers, but other crusaders fight
    in opposition to the follies of the Mortal Realm. It is better to be a
    seraph's ally than their enemy, as they are terrifying foes to those who
    defy their purpose.</span></p><p><span

    each session, roll a number of <strong>d4s</strong> equal to your subclass's
    Spellcast trait and place them on your character sheet in the space
    provided. These are your Prayer Dice. You can spend any number of Prayer
    Dice to aid yourself or an ally within Far range. You can use a spent die's
    value to reduce incoming damage, add to a roll's result after the roll is
    made, or gain Hope equal to the result. At the end of each session, clear
    all unspent Prayer Dice.</p>
