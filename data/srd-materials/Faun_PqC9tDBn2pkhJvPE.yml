    Leap}</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Fauns resemble humanoid goats with curving
    horns, square pupils, and cloven hooves. <span class="og-omit">Though their
    appearances may vary, most fauns have a humanoid torso and a goatlike lower
    body covered in dense fur.</span></p><p class="og-omit">Faun faces can be
    more caprine or more humanlike, and they have a wide variety of ear and horn
    shapes. Faun horns range from short with minimal curvature to much larger
    with a distinct curl. The average faun ranges from 4–6½ feet (1.2–2.0 m)
    tall, but their height can change dramatically from one moment to the next
    based on their stance. The majority of fauns have proportionately long
    limbs, no matter their size or shape, and are known for their ability to
    deliver powerful blows with their split hooves. Fauns live for roughly 225
    years, and as they age, their appearance can become increasingly
    goatlike.</p>
