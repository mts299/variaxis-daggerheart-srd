    within <strong>Far</strong> range, making an attack against all adversaries
    within your weapon's range along that path.</p><p>Choose the order in which
    you deal damage to the targets you succeeded against. For the first, roll
    your weapon damage with a +1 bonus to your <strong>Proficiency</strong>.

    more than once per attack.</p>
