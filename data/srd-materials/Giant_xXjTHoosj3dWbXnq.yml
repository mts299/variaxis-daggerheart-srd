    are towering humanoids with broad shoulders, long arms, and one to three
    eyes. <span class="og-omit">Adult giants range from 6½–8½ feet (2–2.6 m)
    tall and are naturally muscular, regardless of body type. They are easily
    recognized by their wide frames and elongated arms and necks. Though they
    can have up to three eyes, all giants are born with none and remain
    sightless for their first year of life. Until a giant reaches the age of 10
    and their features fully develop, the formation of their eyes may fluctuate.
    Those with a single eye are commonly known as cyclops. The average giant
    lifespan is about 75 years.</span></p>
