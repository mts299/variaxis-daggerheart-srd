    The Storm Fangs are a pack of resilient hunters and lone wolves, fiercely protective of their own.   
    <span class="og-omit">They have forged a way of life in the most desolate and icy lands, 
    developing an intimidating exterior to match their harsh environment. While capable of great 
    gentleness towards the innocent, they are swift and deadly to anyone who threatens their pack.
