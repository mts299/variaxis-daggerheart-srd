    another shadow within Far range. When you reappear, you are
    <em>Cloaked</em>.</p><h6>Specialization Features</h6><p><em><strong>Dark
    Cloud:</strong></em> Make a Spellcast Roll (15). On a success, create a
    temporary dark cloud that covers any area within Close range. Anyone in this
    cloud can't see outside of it, and anyone outside of it can't see in. You're
    considered <em>Cloaked</em> from any adversary for whom the cloud blocks
    line of sight.</p><p><em><strong>Adrenaline:</strong></em> While you're
