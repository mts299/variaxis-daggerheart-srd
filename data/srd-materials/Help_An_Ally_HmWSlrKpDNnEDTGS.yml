    <p>You can spend a Hope to Help an Ally who is making an action roll you
    could feasibly support. When you do this, <strong>describe how you’re
    helping and roll a [[/roll 1d6]]
    @UUID[Compendium.variaxis-daggerheart-srd.srd-materials.Item.EOCcQNYMlH9T7IKu]{Advantage}
    die</strong>.</p><p>Any number of PCs can Help an Ally as long as they spend
    a Hope to do so. The ally being helped might also gain advantage on the roll
    from another source; in this case, they’d roll their own d6 advantage die.
    <strong>If the ally has gained advantage on a roll from multiple sources,
    they take the highest</strong> of all the advantage dice rolled and add the
    result to their action roll.</p>
