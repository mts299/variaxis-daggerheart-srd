    <span class="og-omit">They can be either more humanoid or more fungal in
    appearance, and they come in an assortment of colors, from earth tones to
    bright reds, yellows, purples, and blues. Fungril display an incredible
    variety of bodies, faces, and limbs, as there's no single common shape among
    them. Even their heights range from a tiny 2 feet tall to a staggering 7
    feet (0.6â€“2.1 m) tall. While the common lifespan of a fungril is about 300
    years, some have been reported to live much longer. They can communicate
    nonverbally, and many members of this ancestry use a mycelial array to
    chemically exchange information with other fungril across long
    distances.</span></p>
