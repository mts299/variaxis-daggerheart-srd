    <p>The title of guardian represents an array of martial professions,
    speaking more to their moral compass and unshakeable fortitude than the
    means by which they fight. <span class="og-omit">While many guardians join
    groups of militants for either a country or cause, they're more likely to
    follow those few they truly care for, majority be damned. Guardians are
    known for fighting with remarkable ferocity even against overwhelming odds,
    defending their cohort above all else. Woe betide those who harm the ally of
    a guardian, as the guardian will answer this injury in
    kind.</span></p><p><span

    you can become <em>Unstoppable</em>. You gain an Unstoppable Die. At level
    1, your Unstoppable Die is a <strong>d4</strong>. Place it on your character
    sheet in the space provided, starting with the 1 value facing up. After you
    make a damage roll that deals 1 or more Hit Points to a target, increase the
    Unstoppable Die value by one. When the die's value would exceed its maximum
    value or when the scene ends, remove the die and drop out of
    <em>Unstoppable</em>. At level 5, your Unstoppable Die increases to a
    <strong>d6</strong>.</p><p>While <em>Unstoppable</em>, you gain the
    following benefits:</p><ul class="og-list-disc"><li>You reduce the severity
