  description: >-
    <p>Make a <strong>Spellcast Roll</strong> against all targets within
    <strong>Far</strong> range. Targets you succeed against become temporarily
    <em><strong>Enraptured</strong></em>. While
    <em><strong>Enraptured</strong></em>, a target's attention is fixed on you,
    narrowing their field of view and drowning out any sound but your voice.
    Mark a Stress to force all <em><strong>Enraptured</strong></em> targets to
    mark a Stress, ending this spell.</p>
