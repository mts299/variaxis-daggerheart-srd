    <p><em><strong>Arcane Deflection:</strong></em> Once per long rest, spend a
    Hope to negate the damage of an attack targeting you or an ally within
    <strong>Very Close</strong> range.</p><p><em><strong>Time
    Lock:</strong></em> Target an object within <strong>Far</strong> range. That
    object stops in time and space exactly where it is until your next rest. If
    a creature tries to move it, make a <strong>Spellcast Roll</strong> against
    them to maintain this spell.</p><p><em><strong>Wall of Flame:</strong></em>
    Make a <strong>Spellcast Roll</strong> (15). On a success, create a
    temporary wall of magical flame between two points within
    <strong>Far</strong> range. All creatures in its path must choose a side to
    be on, and anything that subsequently passes through the wall takes [[/roll
    4d10+3]] magic damage.</p>
