    Sense}</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Goblins are small humanoids easily
    recognizable by their large eyes and massive membranous ears. <span
    class="og-omit">With keen hearing and sharp eyesight, they perceive details
    both at great distances and in darkness, allowing them to move through
    less-optimal environments with ease. Their skin and eye colors are
    incredibly varied, with no one hue, either vibrant or subdued, more dominant
    than another. A typical goblin stands between 3–4 feet (0.9–1.2 m) tall, and
    each of their ears is about the size of their head. Goblins are known to use
    ear positions to very specific effect when communicating nonverbally. A
    goblin's lifespan is roughly 100 years, and many maintain their keen hearing
    and sight well into advanced age.</span></p>
