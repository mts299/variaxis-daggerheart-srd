    <p>Infernis are humanoids who possess sharp canine teeth, pointed ears, and
    horns. <span class="og-omit">They are the descendants of demons from the
    Circles Below. On average, infernis range in height from 5–7 feet (1.5–2.1
    m) and are known to have long fingers and pointed nails. Some have long,
    thin, and smooth tails that end in points, forks, or arrowheads. It's common
    for infernis to have two or four horns—though some have crowns of many
    horns, or only one. These horns can also grow asymmetrically, forming
    unique, often curving, shapes that infernis enhance with carving and
    ornamentation. Their skin, hair, and horns come in an assortment of colors
    that can include soft pastels, stark tones, or vibrant hues, such as rosy
    scarlet, deep purple, and pitch black.</span></p><p>Infernis possess a
    <em><strong>dread visage</strong></em> that manifests both involuntarily,
    such as when they experience fear or other strong emotions, or purposefully,
    such as when they wish to intimidate an adversary. This visage can briefly
    modify their appearance in a variety of ways, including lengthening their
    teeth and nails, changing the colors of their eyes, twisting their horns, or
    enhancing their height. On average, infernis live up to 350 years, with some
    attributing this lifespan to their demonic lineage.</p><h4
