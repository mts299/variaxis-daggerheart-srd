    <blockquote><p>Wildborne are often hardy, loyal, nurturing, reclusive,
    sagacious, and
    vibrant.</p></blockquote><h2>Features</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.daggerheart-srd.srd-materials.Item.i5TQ6GhcsSsl5fgD]{Lightfoot}</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Being
    part of a wildborne community means you lived deep within the forest. <span
    class="og-omit">Wildborne communities are defined by their dedication to the
    conservation of their homelands, and many have strong religious or cultural
    ties to the fauna they live among. This results in unique architectural and
    technological advancements that favor sustainability over short-term,
    high-yield results. It is a hallmark of wildborne societies to integrate
    their villages and cities with the natural environment and avoid disturbing
    the lives of the plants and animals. While some construct their lodgings
    high in the branches of trees, others establish their homes on the ground
    beneath the forest canopy. It's not uncommon for wildborne to remain
    reclusive and hidden within their woodland homes.</span></p>
