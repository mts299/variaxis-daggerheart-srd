  description: >-
    <p>Spend any number of Hope to conjure that many magical steeds (such as
    horses, camels, or elephants) that you and your allies can ride until your
    next long rest or the steeds take any damage. </p><p>The steeds double your
    land speed while traveling and, when in danger, allow you to move within
    <strong>Far</strong> range without having to roll. Creatures riding a steed
    gain a -2 penalty to attack rolls and a +2 bonus to damage rolls.</p>
