    part of a loreborne community means you're from a society that favors strong
    academic or political prowess. <span class="og-omit">Loreborne communities
    highly value knowledge, frequently in the form of historical preservation,
    political advancement, scientific study, skill development, or lore and
    mythology compilation. Most members of these communities research in
    institutions built in bastions of civilization, while some eclectic few
    thrive in gathering information from the natural world. Some may be
    isolationists, operating in smaller enclaves, schools, or guilds and
    following their own unique ethos. Others still wield their knowledge on a
    larger scale, making deft political maneuvers across governmental
    landscapes.</span></p>
