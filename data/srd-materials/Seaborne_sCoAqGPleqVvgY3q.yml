    you lived on or near a large body of water. <span class="og-omit">Seaborne
    communities are built, both physically and culturally, around the specific
    waters they call home. Some of these groups live along the shore,
    constructing ports for locals and travelers alike. These harbors function as
    centers of commerce, tourist attractions, or even just a safe place to lay
    down one's head after weeks of travel. Other seaborne live on the water in
    small boats or large ships, with the idea of "home" comprising a ship and
    its crew, rather than any one landmass. No matter their exact location,
    seaborne communities are closely tied to the ocean tides and the creatures
    who inhabit them. Seaborne learn to fish at a young age, and train from
    birth to hold their breath and swim in even the most tumultuous waters.
    Individuals from these groups are highly sought after for their sailing
    skills, and many become captains of vessels, whether within their own
    community, working for another, or even at the helm of a powerful naval
    operation.</span></p>
