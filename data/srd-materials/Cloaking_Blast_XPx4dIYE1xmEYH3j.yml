  description: >-
    <p>When you make a successful Spellcast Roll to cast a different spell, you
    can spend a Hope to become <em>Cloaked</em>. While Cloaked, you remain
    unseen if you are stationary when an adversary moves to where they would
    normally see you. When you move into or within an adversary's line of sight
    or make an attack, you are no longer <em><strong>Cloaked</strong></em>.</p>
