    <p>You have a deeply personal trinket that can be infused with protective
    magic and held as a ward by you or an ally. Describe what it is and why it's
    important to you. The ward's holder can spend a Hope to reduce incoming
    damage by [[/roll 1d8]].</p><p>If the Ward Die result is 8, the ward's power
    ends after it reduces damage this turn. It can be recharged for free on your
    next rest.</p>
