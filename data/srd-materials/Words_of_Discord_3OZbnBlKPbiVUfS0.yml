    <p>Whisper words of discord to an adversary within Melee range and make a
    <strong>Spellcast Roll (13)</strong>. On a success, the target must mark a
    Stress and make an attack against another adversary instead of against you
    or your allies. </p><p>Once this attack is over, the target realizes what
    happened. The next time you cast Words of Discord on them, gain a -5 penalty
    to the Spellcast Roll.</p>
