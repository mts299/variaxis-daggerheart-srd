    in exchange for power. Write their name in the space on your sheet. 
    Then, choose their </strong>spheres of influence</strong> at GM discretion (like Nature & Mischief, 
    Love & War, Knowledge & Shadow, etc.), record them in the space provided and set their value 
    to <strong>+2</strong>. Anytime you increase your <a href="https://callmepartario.github.io/og-dhsrd/#define-tier"

    also <strong>gain a permanent +1 bonus</strong>.
