  description: >-
    <p><em><strong>Repudiate:</strong></em> You can interrupt a magical effect
    taking place. Make a reaction roll using your Spellcast trait. Once per rest
    on a success, the effect stops and any consequences are
    avoided.</p><p><em><strong>Create Construct:</strong></em> Spend a Hope to
    choose a group of objects around you and create an animated construct from
    them that obeys basic commands. Make a <strong>Spellcast Roll</strong> to
    command them to take action. When necessary, they share your Evasion and
    traits and their attacks deal [[/roll 2d10+3]] physical damage.</p><p>You
    can only maintain one construct at a time, and they fall apart when they
    take any amount of damage.</p>
