    <p>Once per rest, make a Spellcast Roll (15). On a success, drop into a
    vision that lets you clearly see and hear any place you have been before as
    though you are standing there in this moment. </p><p>You can move freely in
    this vision and are not constrained by the physics or impediments of a
    physical body. This spell cannot be detected by mundane or magical means.
    </p><p>You drop out of this vision upon taking damage or casting another
    spell.</p>
