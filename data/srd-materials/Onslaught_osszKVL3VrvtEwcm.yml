    <p>When you successfully make an attack with your weapon, you never deal
    damage beneath a target's Major damage threshold (the target always marks a
    minimum of 2 Hit Points).</p><p>Additionally, when a creature within your
    weapon's range deals damage to an ally with an attack that doesn't include
    you, you can mark a Stress to force them to make a Reaction Roll (15). On a
    failure, the target must mark a Hit Point.</p>
