    <p>Play the Divine Wielder if you want to dominate the battlefield with a
    legendary weapon.</p><h6>Spellcast Trait</h6><p>Strength</p><h6>Foundation
    Features</h6><p><em><strong>Spirit Weapon:</strong></em> When you have an
    equipped weapon with a range of Melee or Very Close, it can fly from your
    hand to attack an adversary within Close range and then return to you. You
    can mark a Stress to target an additional adversary within range with the
    same attack roll.</p><p><em><strong>Sparing Touch:</strong></em> Once per
    long rest, touch a creature and clear 2 Hit Points or 2 Stress from
    them.</p><h6>Specialization Feature</h6><p><em><strong>Devout:</strong></em>
    When you roll your Prayer Dice, you can roll an additional die and discard
    the lowest result. Additionally, you can use your <em><strong>Sparing
    Touch</strong></em> feature twice instead of once per long
    rest.</p><h6>Mastery Feature</h6><p><em><strong>Sacred
    Resonance:</strong></em> When you roll damage for your <em><strong>Spirit
    Weapon</strong></em> feature, if any of the die results match, double the
    value of each matching die. For example, if you roll two 5s, they count as
    two 10s.</p>
