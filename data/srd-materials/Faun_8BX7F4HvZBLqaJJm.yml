    <p>Fauns resemble humanoid goats with curving horns, square pupils, and
    cloven hooves. <span class="og-omit">Though their appearances may vary, most
    fauns have a humanoid torso and a goatlike lower body covered in dense
    fur.</span></p><p class="og-omit">Faun faces can be more caprine or more
    humanlike, and they have a wide variety of ear and horn shapes. Faun horns
    range from short with minimal curvature to much larger with a distinct curl.
    The average faun ranges from 4–6½ feet (1.2–2.0 m) tall, but their height
    can change dramatically from one moment to the next based on their stance.
    The majority of fauns have proportionately long limbs, no matter their size
    or shape, and are known for their ability to deliver powerful blows with
    their split hooves. Fauns live for roughly 225 years, and as they age, their
    appearance can become increasingly goatlike.</p><h4 class="h6">Ancestry
