    are humanoids most easily recognized by their square features and boar-like
    tusks that protrude from their lower jaw.</p><p class="og-omit">Tusks come
    in various sizes, and though they extend from the mouth, they aren't used
    for consuming food. Instead, many orcs choose to decorate their tusks with
    significant ornamentation. Orcs typically live for 125 years, and unless
    altered, their tusks continue to grow throughout the course of their lives.
    Their ears are pointed, and their hair and skin typically have green, blue,
    pink, or gray tones. Orcs tend toward a muscular build, and their average
    height ranges from 5–6½ feet (1.5–2.0 m).</p>
