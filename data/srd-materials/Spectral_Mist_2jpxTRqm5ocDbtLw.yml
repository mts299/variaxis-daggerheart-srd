    <p>Mark a stress to summon an eerie mist that turns
    you and any targets within <strong>Close</strong> range
    momentarily incorporeal. While a creature is incorporeal,
    the can move through solid objects and are immune to physical
    damage. A creature becomes corporeal again after they press through
    a solid object or make an action roll. Otherwise, this effect drops
    at the end of the scene.</p>
