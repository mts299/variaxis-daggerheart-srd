    <blockquote><p>Wanderborne are often inscrutable, magnanimous, mirthful,
    reliable, savvy, and
    unorthodox.</p></blockquote><h2>Features</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.variaxis-daggerheart-srd.srd-materials.Item.OtqhUUpnFjyL0Dh6]{Nomadic
    Pack}</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Being part of a wanderborne community means
    you've lived as a nomad, forgoing a permanent home and experiencing a wide
    variety of cultures. <span class="og-omit">Unlike many communities that are
    defined by their locale, wanderborne are defined by their traveling
    lifestyle. Because of their frequent migration, wanderborne put less value
    on the accumulation of material possessions in favor of acquiring
    information, skills, and connections. While some wanderborne are allied by a
    common ethos, such as a religion or a set of political or economic values,
    others come together after shared tragedy, such as the loss of their home or
    land. No matter the reason, the dangers posed by life on the road and the
    choice to continue down that road together mean that wanderborne are known
    for their unwavering loyalty.</span></p>
