  description: >-
    <p>Spend a Hope to summon a humanoid-sized spirit that can move or carry
    things for you until your next rest. You can also send it to attack an
    adversary. When you do, make a <strong>Spellcast Roll</strong> against a
    target within <strong>Very Far</strong> range. </p><p>On a success, the
    spirit moves into <strong>Melee</strong> range with that target. Roll a
    number of [[/roll d6]]s equal to your Spellcast trait and deal that much
    magic damage to the target. The spirit then dissipates. You can only have
    one spirit at a time.</p>
