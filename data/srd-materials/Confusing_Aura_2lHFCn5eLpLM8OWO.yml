  description: >-
    <p>Make a <strong>Spellcast Roll</strong> (14). Once per long rest on a
    success, you create a layer of illusion over your body that makes it hard to
    tell exactly where you are. Mark any number of Stress to make that many
    additional layers. </p><p>When an adversary makes an attack against you,
    roll a number of [[/roll d6]]s equal to the number of layers currently
    active. If any roll a 5 or higher, one layer of the aura is destroyed and
    the attack fails. If all the results are 4 or lower, you take the damage and
    this spell ends.</p>
