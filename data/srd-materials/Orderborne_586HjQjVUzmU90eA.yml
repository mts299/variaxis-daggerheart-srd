    <blockquote><p>Orderborne are often ambitious, benevolent, pensive, prudent,
    sardonic, and
    stoic.</p></blockquote><h2>Features</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.variaxis-daggerheart-srd.srd-materials.Item.SG88ITjhQztrleP8]{Dedicated}</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Being
    part of an orderborne community means you're from a collective that focuses
    on discipline or faith, and you uphold a set of principles that reflect your
    experience there. <span class="og-omit">Orderborne are frequently some of
    the most powerful among the surrounding communities. By aligning the members
    of their society around a common value or goal, such as a god, doctrine,
    ethos, or even a shared business or trade, the ruling bodies of these
    enclaves can mobilize larger populations with less effort. While orderborne
    communities take a variety of forms—some even profoundly pacifistic—perhaps
    the most feared are those that structure themselves around military prowess.
    In such a case, it's not uncommon for orderborne to provide soldiers for
    hire to other cities or countries.</span></p>
