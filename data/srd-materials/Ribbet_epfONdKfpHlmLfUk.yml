    Tongue}</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Ribbets resemble anthropomorphic frogs
    with protruding eyes and webbed hands and feet. <span class="og-omit">They
    have smooth (though sometimes warty) moist skin and eyes positioned on
    either side of their head. Some ribbets have hind legs more than twice the
    length of their torso, while others have short limbs. No matter their size
    (which ranges from about 3–4½ feet (0.9–1.4 m)), ribbets primarily move by
    hopping. All ribbets have webbed appendages, allowing them to swim with
    ease. Some ribbets possess a natural green-and-brown camouflage, while
    others are vibrantly colored with bold patterns. No matter their appearance,
    all ribbets are born from eggs laid in the water, hatch into tadpoles, and
    after about 6 to 7 years, grow into amphibians that can move around on land.
    Ribbets live for approximately 100 years.</span></p>
