    <p>At the beginning of each session, roll a number of <strong>d4s</strong>
    equal to your <a
    href="https://callmepartario.github.io/og-dhsrd/#define-subclass"
    data-bs-original-title>subclass</a>'s Spellcast trait and place them on your
    character sheet in the space provided. These are your Prayer Dice. You can
    spend any number of Prayer Dice to aid yourself or an ally within <a
    href="https://callmepartario.github.io/og-dhsrd/#define-range"
    data-bs-original-title>Far</a> range. You can use a spent die's value to
    reduce incoming damage, add to a roll's result after the roll is made, or
    gain <a href="https://callmepartario.github.io/og-dhsrd/#define-hope"
    data-bs-original-title>Hope</a> equal to the result. At the end of each
    session, clear all unspent Prayer Dice.</p>
