    <p>Spend a Hope to create a single, small floating orb that you can move
    anywhere within <strong>Very Far</strong> range. While this spell is active,
    you can see through the orb as though youâ€™re looking out from its position.
    You can transition between using your own senses and seeing through the orb
    freely. </p><p>If the orb takes damage or moves out of range, the spell
    ends.</p>
