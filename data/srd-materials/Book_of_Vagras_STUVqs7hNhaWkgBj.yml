    <p><em><strong>Runic Lock:</strong></em> Make a <strong>Spellcast
    Roll</strong> (15) on an object youâ€™re touching that can close (such as a
    lock, chest, or box). Once per rest on a success, you can lock the object so
    it can only be opened by creatures of your choice. Someone with access to
    magic and an hour of time to study the spell can break
    it.</p><p><em><strong>Arcane Door:</strong></em> When you have no
    adversaries within Melee range, make a <strong>Spellcast Roll</strong> (13).
    On a success, spend a Hope to create a portal from where you are to a point
    within Far range you can see. It closes once a creature has passed through
    it.</p><p><em><strong>Reveal:</strong></em> Make a <strong>Spellcast
    Roll</strong>. If there is anything magically hidden within
    <strong>Close</strong> range, it is revealed.</p>
