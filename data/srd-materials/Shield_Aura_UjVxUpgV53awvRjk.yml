    <p>Mark a Stress to cast a protective aura on a target within <strong>Very
    Close</strong> range. When the target marks an Armor Slot, they reduce the
    severity of the attack by an additional threshold. </p><p>If this spell
    causes a creature who would be damaged to instead mark no Hit Points, the
    effect ends. </p><p>You can only hold Shield Aura on one creature at a
    time.</p>
