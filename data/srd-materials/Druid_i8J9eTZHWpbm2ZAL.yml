    <p>Becoming a druid is more than an occupation; it's a calling for those who
    wish to learn from and protect the magic of the wilderness. <span
    class="og-omit">While one might underestimate a gentle druid who practices
    the often-quiet work of cultivating flora, druids who channel the untamed
    forces of nature are terrifying to behold. Druids cultivate their abilities
    in small groups, often connected by a specific ethos or locale, but some
    choose to work alone. Through years of study and dedication, druids can
    learn to transform into beasts and shape nature itself.</span></p><p><span

    Hope Feature</h4><p><em><strong>Evolution:</strong></em> Spend 3 Hope to
    transform into a Beastform without marking a Stress. When you do, choose one
    trait to raise by +1 until you drop out of that Beastform.</p><h4
    class="h6">Class Features</h4><ul
    class="list-unstyled"><li><p><em><strong>Beastform:</strong></em> Mark a
    Stress to magically transform into a creature of your tier or lower from the
    Beastform list. You can drop out of this form at any time. While
    transformed, you can't use weapons or cast spells from domain cards, but you
    can still use other features or abilities you have access to. Spells you
    cast before you transform stay active and last for their normal duration,
    and you can talk and communicate as normal. Additionally, you gain the
    Beastform's features, add their Evasion bonus to your Evasion, and use the
    trait specified in their statistics for your attack. While you're in a
    Beastform, your armor becomes part of your body and you mark Armor Slots as
    usual; when you drop out of a Beastform, those marked Armor Slots remain
    marked. If you mark your last Hit Point, you automatically drop out of this
    form.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Wildtouch:</strong></em> You can perform
    harmless, subtle effects that involve nature—such as causing a flower to
    rapidly grow, summoning a slight gust of wind, or starting a campfire—at
    will.</p></li></ul>
