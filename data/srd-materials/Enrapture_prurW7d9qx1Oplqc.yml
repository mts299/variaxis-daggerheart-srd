  description: >-
    <p>Make a <strong>Spellcast Roll</strong> against a target within
    <strong>Close</strong> range. On a success, they become temporarily
    <em><strong>Enraptured</strong></em>. </p><p>While
    <em><strong>Enraptured</strong></em>, a target's attention is fixed on you,
    narrowing their field of view and drowning out any sound but your voice.
    Once per rest on a success, you can mark a Stress to force the Enraptured
    target to mark a Stress as well.</p>
