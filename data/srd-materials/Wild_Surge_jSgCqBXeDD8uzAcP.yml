  description: >-
    <p>Once per long rest, mark a Stress to channel the natural world around you
    and enhance yourself. Describe how your appearance changes, then place a
    <strong>d6</strong> on this card with the 1 value facing up. </p><p>While
    the Wild Surge Die is active, you add its value to every action roll you
    make. After you add its value to a roll, increase the Wild Surge Die's value
    by one. When the die's value would exceed 6 or you take a rest, this form
    drops and you must mark an additional Stress.</p>
