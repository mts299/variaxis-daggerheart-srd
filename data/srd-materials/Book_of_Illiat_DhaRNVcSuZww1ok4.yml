    <p><em><strong>Slumber:</strong></em> Make a <strong>Spellcast Roll</strong>
    against a target within <strong>Very Close</strong> range. On a success,
    they're Asleep until they take damage or the GM spends a Fear on their turn
    to clear this condition.<br /><br /><em><strong>Arcane
    Barrage:</strong></em> Once per rest, spend any number of Hope and shoot
    magical projectiles that strike a target of your choice within
    <strong>Close</strong> range. Roll a number of [[/roll d6]]s equal to the
    Hope spent and deal that much magic damage to the target.<br /><br
    /><em><strong>Telepathy:</strong></em> Spend a Hope to open a line of mental
    communication with one target you can see. This connection lasts until your
    next rest or you cast Telepathy again.</p>
