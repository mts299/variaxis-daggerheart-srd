    <p>Any time you would be <a
    href="https://callmepartario.github.io/og-dhsrd/#define-condition"
    data-bs-original-title><em>Hidden</em></a>, you are instead
    <em>Cloaked</em>. In addition to the benefits of the <a
    href="https://callmepartario.github.io/og-dhsrd/#define-condition"
    data-bs-original-title><em>Hidden</em></a> condition, while <em>Cloaked</em>
    you remain unseen if you are stationary when an <a
    href="https://callmepartario.github.io/og-dhsrd/#define-adversary"
    data-bs-original-title>adversary</a> moves to where they would normally see
    you. After you make an <a
    href="https://callmepartario.github.io/og-dhsrd/#define-attack-roll"
    data-bs-original-title>attack</a> or end a move within line of sight of an
    adversary, you are no longer <em>Cloaked</em>. Otherwise, this bonus lasts
    until your next rest.</p>
