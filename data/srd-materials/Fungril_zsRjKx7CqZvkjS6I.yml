    <p>Fungril resemble humanoid mushrooms. <span class="og-omit">They can be
    either more humanoid or more fungal in appearance, and they come in an
    assortment of colors, from earth tones to bright reds, yellows, purples, and
    blues. Fungril display an incredible variety of bodies, faces, and limbs, as
    there's no single common shape among them. Even their heights range from a
    tiny 2 feet tall to a staggering 7 feet (0.6–2.1 m) tall. While the common
    lifespan of a fungril is about 300 years, some have been reported to live
    much longer. They can communicate nonverbally, and many members of this
    ancestry use a mycelial array to chemically exchange information with other
    fungril across long distances.</span></p><h4 class="h6">Ancestry
