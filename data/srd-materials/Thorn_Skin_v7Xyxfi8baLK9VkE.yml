    <p>Once per rest, spend a Hope to sprout thorns all over your body. When you
    do, place a number of tokens equal to your Spellcast trait on this card.
    </p><p>When you take damage, you can spend any number of tokens to roll that
    number of [[/roll d6]]s. Add the results together and reduce the incoming
    damage by that amount. If you're within <strong>Melee</strong> range of the
    attacker, deal that amount of damage back to them. </p><p>When you take a
    rest, clear all unspent tokens.</p>
