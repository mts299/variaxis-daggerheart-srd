    <blockquote><p>Slyborne are often calculating, clever, formidable,
    perceptive, shrewd, and
    tenacious.</p></blockquote><h2>Features</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.daggerheart-srd.srd-materials.Item.CSF1KbbQkWIm4SBt]{Scoundrel}</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Being
    part of a slyborne community means you come from a group that operates
    outside the law, including all manner of criminals, grifters, and con
    artists. <span class="og-omit">Members of slyborne communities are brought
    together by their disreputable goals and their clever means of achieving
    them. Many people in these communities have an array of unscrupulous skills:
    forging, thievery, smuggling, and violence. People of any social class can
    be slyborne, from those who have garnered vast wealth and influence to those
    without a coin to their name. To the outside eye, slyborne might appear to
    be ruffians with no loyalty, but these communities possess some of the
    strictest codes of honor which, when broken, can result in a terrifying end
    for the transgressor.</span></p>
