  description: >-
    <p><strong>Stress</strong> represents how much mental, physical, and
    emotional strain a character can endure. Some special abilities or effects
    require the character activating them to mark Stress, and the GM can require
    a PC to mark Stress as a GM move or to represent the cost, complication, or
    consequence of an action roll.</p><p>When a character marks their last
    Stress, they become
    @UUID[Compendium.variaxis-daggerheart-srd.srd-materials.Item.pVg7g82AfOmtxjWU]{Vulnerable}
    until they clear at least 1 Stress.</p><p>When a character must mark 1 or
    more Stress but can’t, they mark 1 HP instead. A character can’t use a move
    that requires them to mark Stress if all of their Stress is
    marked.</p><p>PCs can clear Stress by making downtime moves. A PC’s maximum
    Stress is determined by their class, but they can increase it through
    advancements, abilities, and other effects.</p>
