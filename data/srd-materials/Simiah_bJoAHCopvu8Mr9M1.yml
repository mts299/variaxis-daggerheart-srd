    and apes with long limbs and prehensile feet. <span class="og-omit">While
    their appearance reflects all simian creatures, from the largest gorilla to
    the smallest marmoset, their size does not align with their animal
    counterparts, and they can be anywhere from 2–6 feet (0.6–1.8 m) tall. All
    simiah can use their dexterous feet for nonverbal communication, work, and
    combat. Additionally, some also have prehensile tails that can grasp objects
    or help with balance during difficult maneuvers. These traits grant members
    of this ancestry unique agility that aids them in a variety of physical
    tasks. In particular, simiah are skilled climbers and can easily transition
    from bipedal movement to knuckle-walking and climbing, and back again. On
    average, simiah live for about 100 years.</span></p>
