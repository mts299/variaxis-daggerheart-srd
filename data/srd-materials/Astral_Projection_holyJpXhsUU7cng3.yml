    <p>Once per long rest, mark a Stress to create a projected copy of yourself
    that can appear anywhere you've been before. You can see and hear through
    the projection as though it were you and affect the world as though you were
    there. </p><p>A creature investigating the projection can tell it's of
    magical origin. This effect lasts until your next rest or your projection
    takes any damage.</p>
