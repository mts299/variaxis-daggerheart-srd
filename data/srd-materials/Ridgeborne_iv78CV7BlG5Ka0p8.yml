    <blockquote><p>Ridgeborne are often bold, hardy, indomitable, loyal,
    reserved, and
    stubborn.</p></blockquote><h2>Features</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.daggerheart-unofficial-srd.srd-materials.Item.6xffpE9XidQi2pqY]{Steady}</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Being
    part of a ridgeborne community means you've called the rocky peaks and sharp
    cliffs of the mountainside home. <span class="og-omit">Those who've lived in
    the mountains often consider themselves hardier than most because they've
    thrived among the most dangerous terrain many continents have to offer.
    These groups are adept at adaptation, developing unique technologies and
    equipment to move both people and products across difficult terrain. As
    such, ridgeborne grow up scrambling and climbing, making them sturdy and
    strong-willed. Ridgeborne localities appear in a variety of forms—some
    cities carve out entire cliff faces, others construct castles of stone, and
    still more live in small homes on windblown peaks. Outside forces often
    struggle to attack ridgeborne groups, as the small militias and large
    military forces of the mountains are adept at utilizing their high-ground
    advantage.</span></p>
