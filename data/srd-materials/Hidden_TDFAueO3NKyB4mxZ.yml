    <p>While you’re out of sight from all foes and they don’t know where you
    are, you gain the <em><strong>Hidden</strong></em> condition. While
    <em>Hidden</em> any rolls against you have
    @UUID[Compendium.variaxis-daggerheart-srd.srd-materials.Item.ouVh4k105I1Jc1QS]{Disadvantage}.
    <br /><br />After an adversary moves to where they would see you, you move
    into their line of sight, or you make an attack, you are no longer
    <em><strong>Hidden</strong></em>.</p>
