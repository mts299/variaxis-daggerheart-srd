    <p>When an attack made against you that would deal physical damage fails,
    you can spend a Hope to envelop yourself in shadow, becoming
    @UUID[Compendium.variaxis-daggerheart-srd.srd-materials.Item.TDFAueO3NKyB4mxZ]{hidden}
    and teleporting to a point within <strong>Close</strong> range of the
    attacker. You remain <em><strong>Hidden</strong></em> until the next time
    you make an action roll.</p>
